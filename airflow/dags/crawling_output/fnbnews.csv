Govt to amend rules for packaged goods; traders fear inflation,"The Central Government is preparing to amend the legal metrology rules for packaged goods.Traders fear inflation will increase further as the proposed rules will include packages weighing more than 25 kg under the purview of GST. Shankar Thakkar, president of All India Edible Oil Traders Federation, has said that the Consumer Affairs Department has proposed an amendment to the Legal Metrology Rules, which will make it mandatory to display information including name, country of origin and expiry date etc. on all packaged goods sold for retail sale (for any quantity).""Currently, the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, barring some exceptions, do not apply to packaged commodities weighing more than 25 kg or 25 litre. Now, DoCA is proposing to make the rules mandatory for all pre-packaged commodities meant for retail sale, even if the quantity exceeds 25 kg or 25 litre,"" said Thakkar.These rules currently do not apply to packages of commodities having a quantity exceeding 25 kg or 25 litre except in the case of cement, fertilisers and agricultural produce sold in bags up to 50 kg in the retail channel. These rules also do not apply to products packaged for industrial and institutional consumers and to cement, fertilisers and agricultural produce sold in bags exceeding 50 kg.The amended provision will provide that these rules will apply to all packaged commodities sold in bags at retail, except for commodities packaged for industrial consumers.The DoCA reasoned that till now, the rules did not apply to large packs having quantities of more than 25 kg or litre as it was held that such packs are not meant for retail sale. DoCA added that packaged commodities above 25 kg were found available in the market for retail sale, which is not in consonance with the intent of making all declarations on pre-packaged commodities meant for retail sale.The department said the amendment is being proposed in view of the evolving market on both offline and online channels.""This amended provision will help in establishing uniform standards and requirements for packaged commodities, promote consistency and fairness across different brands and products and help consumers make informed choices,"" DoCA said.Meanwhile, Thakkar has urged all the agri traders to oppose the move and asked government to reconsider the decision. He said, ""All the organisations of the country, especially those related to agricultural products, are called upon to register their objections or suggestions within the next 15 days i.e. by 29th July so that the government reconsiders making this amendments.""",2024-07-20,"Ashwani Maindola, New Delhi",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/govt-to-amend-rules-for-packaged-goods-traders-fear-inflation-79092

India’s importance to Malaysia’s oil palm sector cannot be understated. Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and I have envisioned a partnership that benefits both our nations. This partnership will also meaningfully contribute towards achieving global food security needs and sustainability goals.”Palm oil stands out as one of the most efficient edible oils in terms of productivity and land use. Globally, oil palm trees occupy less than 8% of the total land area dedicated to all crops, yet they contribute 32% to major seed oil production. Amid mounting global concerns about climate change and deforestation, palm oil is uniquely positioned to efficiently meet the rising global demand for edible oils.On the importance of sustainable palm oil consumption and cultivation Minister Ghani said, “Malaysia is deeply committed to sustainable palm oil production, adhering to stringent environmental standards and sustainable practices.

"Government is expected to do higher allocation towards agriculture, welfare schemes, job creation and rural housing","The Union Budget will focus on Supporting consumption via higher allocation for rural economy, welfare schemes and agriculture. It expects focus on manufacturing and capex to continue as Government likely to retain its interim budget’s target of capex. Government is likely to retain capex target for FY25 at Rs 11.1 trillion. Overall public capex grew by 15.1% in FY24. A slowdown in state capex and contraction in CPSE capex moderated overall public capex growth in FY24. CPSE capex have contracted over the past few years. However, FY25 interim budget saw a 5.2% growth in allocation to CPSEs for capex. For CPSEs, capex has been led by petroleum and natural gas, power, and renewable energy, according to CareEdge Ratings.On revenue front, the higher-than-expected transfer from the RBI could provide an additional upside of Rs 1.25 trillion to the non-tax revenue compared to budgeted amount. Gross tax revenue to grow by 11% in FY25, higher than budgeted growth of 10.6% led by strong growth in direct tax collections. A total upside of Rs 1.4 trillion in overall revenue collection when compared to estimates of interim budget (~Rs 1.25 trillion in non-tax revenue plus ~Rs 150 billion from tax revenue). Tax buoyancy at 1.04 marginally higher than budgeted buoyancy of 0.96 in FY25, according to CareEdge Ratings.Additional revenue growth expected to help reduce the fiscal deficit target for FY25 to 5% of GDP (from interim budget’s target of 5.1% of GDP), even after accounting for higher revenue expenditure. The company expects incremental revenue expenditure of Rs 750 billion compared to the Interim Budget estimate. The company expects higher projection of nominal GDP growth for FY25 at 10.7% (as against interim budget estimate of 10.5%). It says, general Government debt has shot up to 83% of GDP in FY24, resulting in high interest burden. With sovereign rating agencies watching the debt trajectory, the focus on fiscal consolidation should continue.The company believes Government borrowing is expected to fall, with net borrowing in the range of Rs 11.2-11.4 trillion (Rs 11.8 trillion as per Interim Budget) and gross borrowing expected between Rs 13.6-13.8 trillion (Rs 14.1 trillion as per Interim Budget) in FY25. Lower supply of G-secs in FY25, combined with increased demand resulting from passive inflows following India's inclusion in global bond indices, is expected to ease G-sec yields in the fiscal year.  Anticipation of the RBI initiating policy rate cuts in H2 may further exert downward pressure on G-sec yields. By the end of FY25, 10-year G-Sec yields are projected to range between 6.5-6.6%. It believes government's divestment plans have missed their targets for five consecutive years. Hence, Government is likely to stick to the FY25 target of miscellaneous capital receipts (includes divestment) of Rs 500 billion. However, achieving this target hinges on government undertaking big-ticket divestments. Government has relied on OFS route for undertaking divestments in the recent years. Issues like procedural delays, litigations by labour unions/interest groups, and pricing issues continue to slow divestments. According to Sachin Gupta, CRO & executive director, CareEdge Ratings, said, “Job creation will be a priority in this Union Budget with higher allocation for MNREGA and PLI for labour intensive sectors. The allocation under major PLI schemes have grown significantly in FY25. Large Scale Electronics and IT Hardware, Automobiles and auto components and Pharma has dominated most of the allocation under the PLI Scheme in the interim budget. Government may look to increase allocation or include more labour-intensive sectors like textiles, leather and footwear and toys to aid job creation. We also expect welfare schemes to get higher allocation in this budget, while Capex will continue to remain in focus.”.Rajani Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge Ratings, said, “Over past couple of years, share of revenue expenditure in total expenditure has declined from pre-pandemic average of ~88%. We expect FY25 revenue expenditure to grow by 6.8%, higher than budgeted growth of 4.6% resulting in ~ Rs 750 billion higher allocation compared to interim budget’s estimate. Government is expected to do higher allocation towards agriculture, welfare schemes, job creation and rural housing. Some of the major schemes/ministries that can see higher allocation include MNREGA, PM Awas Yojana, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and schemes related labour intensive MSME sectors. We estimate total divestment potential of Rs 11.5 trillion (assuming Centre retains 51% stake). However, decision to divest will depend on market conditions and strategic nature of the firms. In case divestment lags going ahead due to headwinds, the government will continue with its focus on asset monetization. Plausible divestment includes Shipping Corp, Pawan Hans, NMDC Steel and CONCOR.”",2024-07-18,"Our Bureau, Mumbai",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/government-is-expected-to-do-higher-allocation-towards-agriculture-welfare-schemes-job-creation-and-rural-housing-79080

Beyond Land: Plastic's hidden threat to our planet's health,"As we recommit to protect earth from increasing threat of plastic pollution, an urgent action to heal our wounded landscapes is the need of the hour.Land degradation, desertification, and drought are interconnected threats impacting billions of people worldwide. They diminish fertile land, disrupt food production, and displace communities. The consequences are dire for both human well-being and ecosystem health.A significant contributor to land degradation is plastic pollution.  Over 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced every year globally, with half designed for single-use. Less than 10% is recycled, leaving a vast amount accumulating in landfills and ecosystems.  The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) sounds the alarm: plastic use in farming is skyrocketing, reaching a staggering 12.5 million tonnes annually. These plastics, primarily films used in vegetable, fruit, crop, and livestock production, ultimately end up in the soil - their final resting place.Professor Elaine Baker of the University of Sydney highlights the gravity of the situation: ""We only have so much agricultural land. The build-up of plastic can severely damage soil health, biodiversity, and productivity, all crucial for food security.""This plastic pollution harms the environment in several ways:Microplastics: When plastic breaks down, it fragments into tiny particles called microplastics, which contaminate soil and harm beneficial organisms like earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi, essential for healthy soil and plant growth. Studies show microplastics can also transfer into the food chain, potentially threatening food safety and human health. A 2020 study in Science of the Total Environment found that plastic contamination represents a significant amount (14%) of global plastic pollution.Disrupted Nutrient Cycles: Plastic debris can impede plant growth by hindering their ability to properly absorb nutrients from the soil.Water Contamination: Agricultural practices contribute significantly to plastic pollution in waterways through irrigation pipes, fertiliser pellets, and containers. Approximately 10% of marine plastic pollution originates from agricultural sources. This plastic disrupts aquatic ecosystems and poses a threat to marine life.Lingering Legacy: Improperly disposed-of plastics like bags, bottles, and packaging accumulate in the soil. Because they take a long time to decompose naturally, they become a permanent resident, hindering plant growth by blocking nutrient absorption. Additionally, they can clog irrigation systems, leading to water stagnation and crop losses.Beyond the Obvious: Plastics extend far beyond simple films. They are used in seed coatings, protective wraps for temperature control and weed prevention, and even incorporated into biosolid fertilisers. Irrigation tubes, sacks, and bottles further contribute to the plastic burden.Silent Threat: The release of harmful substances from plastics into the environment poses a potential risk to human health. Plants can absorb these toxins, introducing them into the food chain.Breeding Grounds for Trouble: Accumulated plastic, combined with stagnant water, creates a haven for pests and vector-borne diseases. This can introduce harmful microbes that threaten both plant and human health.The message is clear: the convenience of plastic in agriculture comes at a hidden cost to our soil, food security, and ultimately, our health.Case Study: India's Plastic Pesticide Bottle ProblemIndia's heavy reliance on plastic bottles for pesticides and agrochemicals exemplifies the challenges faced globally.  The Central Pollution Control Board estimates an annual consumption of 10,000 to 12,000 metric tons of these bottles, with only a meager 10-15% being recycled according to the Indian Institute of Packaging.  These plastic bottles, typically made of HDPE (high-density polyethylene), are convenient and cost-effective, but their improper disposal creates a major environmental headache.  Landfills overflowing with these bottles or their incineration contribute significantly to overall plastic waste on Indian farmlands.The impact of plastic pollution extends beyond land degradation.  The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that plastic waste is projected to almost triple by 2060, with significant consequences for climate change, biodiversity loss, and human health.Statistics and In-Depth Explanations:While the focus of World Environment Day 2024 is land restoration, plastic pollution remains a significant threat to our planet's health and a major contributor to land degradation. The provided statistics highlight the alarming scale of the problem:Projected Tripling of Plastic Waste: The OECD report underscores the urgency of addressing plastic pollution. The projected tripling of plastic waste by 2060 signifies a looming crisis that demands immediate and collective action.Microplastics and Soil Contamination: The explanation regarding microplastics and their detrimental impact on soil organisms delves deeper into the complex issue of plastic pollution. It highlights the potential threat to food safety and human health, emphasising the need for sustainable alternatives.Agricultural Plastic Use and Impact: The statistics on agricultural plastic use provide a clearer picture of the scope of the problem. The details on the various ways agricultural plastics harm soil health and potentially contaminate crops further emphasise the need for sustainable practices in agriculture.However, there is hope. Land restoration offers a powerful solution for mitigating plastic pollution and its associated problems. By restoring degraded land, we can:Reduce reliance on single-use plastics: Healthy ecosystems provide alternatives for packaging and other applications currently dominated by plastics.Promote sustainable agriculture: Practices that minimise plastic use and encourage composting can significantly reduce plastic waste in the agricultural sector.Enhance waste management: Improved waste collection and recycling infrastructure can prevent plastic from entering the environment.Here's how we can all contribute towards stopping the Plastic pollution:Individuals:Reduce your consumption: Consume less meat, textiles, and other products that drive land degradation and plastic use.Support sustainable practices: Choose products with responsible sourcing, minimal packaging, and alternatives to single-use plastics.Plant trees: Trees offer numerous benefits, including soil protection, carbon sequestration, and promoting biodiversity which can help break down plastic pollutants.Compost food scraps: Composting reduces landfill waste, creates nutrient-rich soil amendments, and minimises the need for plastic fertilisers.Spread awareness: Educate others about the importance of land restoration and the detrimental effects of plastic pollution.Governments and Institutions:Invest in land restoration projects: Allocate resources to support large-scale restoration efforts that promote sustainable land management practices.Implement regulations to protect ecosystems and reduce plastic pollution: Enact policies that safeguard natural habitats, encourage sustainable land use, and restrict single-use plastics.Develop research and funding for plastic alternatives: Support the development of biodegradable materials and innovative solutions to manage plastic waste effectively.Businesses:Adopt sustainable supply chains: Source materials from responsible producers who prioritise land conservation and minimise plastic use.Develop innovative solutions: Invest in research and development of technologies that support land regeneration and biodegradation of plastics.Reduce waste: Minimise packaging and implement responsible waste management strategies.Innovation and Sustainable PracticesReducing Plastic at the Source:Biodegradable Mulch Films: Replacing traditional plastic mulches with films derived from organic materials like starch or cellulose offers a promising solution. These films decompose naturally, eliminating collection and disposal concerns.Refillable Pesticide Containers: Switching from single-use pesticide bottles to refillable containers made from durable materials like stainless steel can significantly reduce plastic waste.Sustainable Packaging:Bio-based Plastics: These alternatives, derived from renewable sources like corn or sugarcane, can be used for packaging, plant pots, and trays.Natural Fibers: Hemp, jute, and coconut coir offer eco-friendly options for plant pots, erosion control blankets, and packaging.Supporting Eco-Conscious Businesses:Look for companies actively exploring and utilising eco-friendly alternatives to plastics.  This incentivises responsible production and empowers consumers to be part of the solution.Education and AwarenessBuilding a culture of sustainability in agriculture requires educating farmers, consumers, and policymakers.  Programs promoting awareness, capacity building, and sustained advocacy can empower all stakeholders to make informed choices.Investing in KnowledgeResearch and development play a crucial role in finding sustainable plastic alternatives. Exploring novel materials like biodegradable polymers and bio-based packaging can ensure functionality without environmental harm.Technology for a Brighter TomorrowModern technological advancements like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be our allies in our quest for plastic impact and usage mitigation.AI for Cleanup Prioritisation: Utilising AI to analyse satellite imagery and deploy AI-equipped drones can identify plastic hotspots, allowing for targeted cleanup efforts.AI for Modeling Plastic Impact: AI models can simulate the impact of plastics on soil health and ecosystems, guiding policymakers and farmers in developing long-term solutions.AI for Waste Segregation: AI-powered systems can enhance waste segregation, reducing human error and ensuring efficiency.AI for Sustainable Planning: AI-assisted planning can optimise plastic usage in agricultural businesses, minimising environmental impact.Building a Sustainable FuturePlastic pollution has become a defining challenge of our time. Its pervasive presence across the earth, air, water, and living organisms (geosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere) demands immediate and collective action.While a single solution may seem elusive, hope lies in the growing momentum towards sustainable alternatives. Just as we created this plastic problem, we have the power to solve it together. This requires a two-pronged approach: individual behavioral change and advocating for systemic change from corporations and governments.Individual actions, coupled with advocacy for systemic change, can pave the way for a more sustainable future. By working together, we can ensure the well-being of our environment and future generations. Just as Maya Angelou reminds us, ""We need each other as we need the Earth we share."" Let's embrace this responsibility and build a world free from plastic pollution.(The author is working with an international developmentsupport organisation as its Asia regional head)",2024-07-17,Dr Jagat Patnaik,https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/beyond-land-plastics-hidden-threat-to-our-planets-health-79068
85% of consumers’ food habits altered by the pandemic: Expert urges food manufacturers to focus on functional foods,"Since the Covid-19 pandemic, consumer attitudes towards food and drink have become increasingly health-conscious. The International Food Information Council’s annual Food & Health Survey revealed that the pandemic altered the food habits of 85% of consumers, with approximately 1 in 5 making healthier choices. This trend has continued since, as evidenced by data from Statista in March 2024, which revealed that 60% of consumers are actively trying to eat healthily, while 25% prioritise convenience and speed in their food choices, especially with many individuals returning to office settings following the pandemic. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicates that 41% of people had reported commuting to work in recent months, rather than working from home.In light of this Andreas Preisler, Strategic Business Development Manager for Health and Nutrition at Ohly, a provider of yeast-based solutions to support immune health, explains why food producers must acknowledge and address the growing consumer desire for functional foods that not only enhance wellbeing but also align with the fast-paced routines of the modern workforce. What role do functional foods play in improving immune health?The emphasis on functional foods, which provide health support as well as basic nutrition, is now more important than ever. Beta-glucans and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are increasingly recognised as powerful components in improving immune function and overall wellness.According to the Innova Trends Survey 2024, more than 1 in 4 consumers claim to be “proactive” in preventing health issues.Functional foods can go beyond basic nutrition by enhancing digestive health, decreasing inflammation, and strengthening the immune system.Incorporation strategies for food manufacturersEnhancing nutrition within cereal barsFood manufacturers can incorporate beta-glucans into breakfast cereals and bars to better meet the needs of health-conscious consumers. In addition to offering immune support, yeast beta-glucans have also been shown to contribute to cardiovascular health by reducing cholesterol levels.You could also consider adding medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) as a great way to provide a source of healthy fats, and a quick energy boost. NEIVA MCT Immune can be formulated in various dosage forms and has many applications in functional food, sports nutrition, and dietary supplements.Boosting the nutritional profile of dairy and plant-based alternativesFood manufacturers wanting to enhance the nutritional content of dairy products like yoghurt, or plant-based alternatives such as almond or oat milk, should consider incorporating yeast beta-glucans into their recipes. MCT, medium-chain triglycerides, can also be incorporated into products such as creamers and smoothies. For taste and texture, it is important to use finely milled powder that is insoluble to maintain a creamy consistency. NEIVA MCT Powder and NEIVA MCT Immune are designed to enhance texture, nutrition and functionality offering seamless dispersion with a free-flowing easy-to-use powder.  This will enable manufacturers to incorporate added health benefits, without compromising on palatability.Additional health benefits for sports nutrition applicationsMedium-chain triglycerides are particularly important when it comes to sports nutrition as they are rapidly absorbed into the body and quickly converted into energy. Incorporating MCTs into energy bars and gels, or fortifying sports drinks and smoothies can play a large role in providing sustained energy and improving endurance. By food manufacturers focussing on integrating immune-boosting components such as beta-glucans and MCTs into popular foods, we can do our part to aid in fortifying the immune systems of consumers whilst still providing quick, convenient food solutions. There are different types of beta-glucans, from various sources including yeast, oats and fungi. Beta-glucans derived from yeast, especially those sourced from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as baker’s yeast, have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in regulating the immune system.The demand for these foods has surged in recent years, as consumers continue to grow more health-conscious and aware of what they consume. Research suggests that the convenience of food is a high priority for many. Driven by a public increasingly interested in proactive health measures, the pressure is on food manufacturers to provide healthy solutions to those on the go.Ohly’s NEIVA Glucan Max contains high-quality yeast beta-glucan with a high degree of branching, which naturally stimulates the immune system. It is both a prebiotic and a fibre NEIVA MCT Immune, incorporated into sports nutrition products like energy gels, recovery drinks, and protein powders that can contribute to appetite balance and support weight management. As veganism and flexitarianism continue to gain popularity, along with the increasing demand for dairy and meat substitutes, our NEIVA MCT Plant-Based Powder can serve as an excellent dairy alternative replacement. By employing ingredients like these, we can help consumers support their health and overall wellbeing.(The author is strategic business developmentmanager for health and nutrition at Ohly)",2024-07-17,Andreas Preisler,https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/85-of-consumers-food-habits-altered-by-the-pandemic-expert-urges-food-manufacturers-to-focus-on-functional-foods-79067

Nova Dairy launches initiative to improve animal welfare in cattle supply chain,"Nova Dairy, a leading name in the dairy industry, has announced the launch of a comprehensive initiative aimed at improving animal welfare within its cattle supply chain. This programme underscores the company’s commitment to ethical practices and sustainable agriculture, recognising that the health and well-being of dairy cattle are paramount to producing high-quality milk.The company’s initiative will focus on educating farmers across various regions about the critical importance of animal welfare. By providing training and resources, the company aims to promote best practices in cattle management, ensuring that animals are treated with care and respect throughout their lives.Ravin Saluja, director at Sterling Agro Industries Ltd., said, ""Farmers are the backbone of our supply chain. We believe that by empowering them with knowledge and tools, we can collectively enhance the health and productivity of our cattle, leading to better outcomes for everyone involved, from the farmers to the end consumers.""The health of dairy cattle directly influences the quality and quantity of milk produced. A stressed or unhealthy cow is less likely to produce milk efficiently, which can have significant economic implications for farmers. By focusing on animal welfare, Nova Dairy aims to create a more resilient and productive supply chain.One of the key components of Nova Dairy's initiative is advocating for the freedom of cattle to graze naturally. Research and practical experience have shown that cows that are allowed to roam and graze freely exhibit better mental and physical health compared to those that are confined.""When cows are tied and restricted, they experience discomfort and stress, which negatively impacts their milk production. In contrast, cows that graze freely not only produce more milk but also have better mental well-being.

Hi-Food USA unveils value added ingredients of natural origin,"Hi-Food USA – US-based sister company of HIFOOD, a firm specialised in the research, development, and production of natural-origin ingredients and part of CSM Group together with CSM Ingredients – will join for the first time IFT FIRST, North America's largest food innovation expo, taking place from July 14 to 17, in Chicago. The event provides the ideal context for the company to present its latest innovations when it comes to added value ingredients of natural origin, that not only ensure benefits from a nutritional and cleaner labelling standpoint, but also allow to reduce production costs and lessen the environmental impact of finished products.In particular, it will present at its stand (#1375) its most recent solutions, all of natural origin, designed specifically to address the requests of today’s consumers: better-for-you foods, longer shelf-life, free-from solutions (gluten-free, allergen-free, additive-free) and protein and fiber enhancement. Massimo Ambanelli, CSM Group chief commercial officer Americas and Asia, said, “At HIFOOD, our mission is to offer our customers natural solutions developed through an innovative and technological approach to meet the ever-changing needs of today’s modern industry. Working every day with natural ingredients, we have the opportunity to witness how often they provide us with the key to integrating better nutrition, natural origin, and sustainability with the cost-effectiveness and production requirements of today's modern food industry. That’s why we are excited to be at IFT to share with our customers this knowledge and the incredible potential of natural ingredients.” Among the solutions that Hi-Food USA will present at the fair are clean label systems to partially or completely replace whole egg, egg white, or egg yolk in selected applications such as sauces, bakery and pastry products, gluten-free items, and ready meals. Replacing or reducing eggs presents a significant challenge due to their multifunctional properties—they provide protein, thicken, coagulate, foam, stabilise, and emulsify. However, many companies prioritise their substitution due to costs, sustainability concerns, allergen considerations, and the risk of microbiological contamination. HIFOOD solutions offer numerous advantages: they take an allergen away from the final product, can reduce the environmental impact, and can achieve substantial cost savings—up to 80% cheaper depending on the specific recipe and ingredients used.Naturally, egg replacement and reduction are just one aspect of HIFOOD’s extensive portfolio, which includes clean-label solutions for reducing salt, sugar, and calorie content, as well as enhancing protein and fiber, all available globally. IFT FIRST will also be the occasion to unveil the important outcomes of the business collaboration between HIFOOD and Alianza Team, already recognised as winners of the 2023 Fi Europe ‘Plant-based Innovation Award’ for their clean-label and allergen-free version of the protein emulsion MirrorTissue. In particular, the two companies will present some of their product innovations, including BakersBlend, a, multipurpose bakery technology that impacts fats, and PowerUp, a powdered ingredient blend with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), proteins and fibers, perfect for sports nutrition.",2024-07-13,Chicago,https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/hifood-usa-unveils-value-added-ingredients-of-natural-origin-78036

CHOMP and TheMilSource challenge Soho House Hong Kong chef to transform food waste into a culinary feast,"Following the success of the inaugural event, food-saving app CHOMP and TheMilSource (TMS) have announced The Rescued Feast – The Second Bite, set to take place at 7pm on July 25, in collaboration with Soho House Hong Kong. This unique dining experience continues to break new ground by transforming food waste into an upscale culinary feast, underscoring the vital importance of sustainability and innovation in addressing food waste. Food waste remains a significant issue in Hong Kong, with over 3,600 tonnes of food discarded daily, according to the Environmental Protection Department. This wastage contributes to the city's mounting landfill problems and environmental degradation. Recent government initiatives, such as the ""Food Wise Hong Kong Campaign"" and the promotion of food donation programmes, have sought to mitigate the issue, yet the challenge persists. The Rescued Feast aims to spotlight this pressing problem by turning food surplus and scraps into gourmet meals, demonstrating the potential of rescued food. This event not only provides an exceptional dining experience but also serves as a platform to educate the public on the importance of food waste reduction and sustainable practices. Cornerstone to this event, chef Chris Czerwinski from Soho House Hong Kong will be faced with the exciting challenge of curating an inspiring menu for 250 people to experience, utilising food surplus and food scraps within 24 hours. The unpredictable nature of food surplus from the participating food sponsors means that chef Chris and the Soho House team will need to be innovative and use the surplus food in a creative way. He said, “We can’t wait to take part in this brilliant initiative and provide support that champions reducing food waste in Hong Kong.” Carla Martinesi, founder of CHOMP, said, ""We are incredibly excited to bring back The Rescued Feast. Our mission at CHOMP is to reduce food waste and showcase how surplus food can be transformed into something truly extraordinary. The support we've received has been phenomenal, and we can't wait to continue this journey with TMS."" Krystal Lai, founder of TMS, said, ""I'm amazed by the outpour of support from the community for our Rescued Feast series. These events are just going to get bigger and bigger, and it's inspiring to see so many people come together to tackle the issue of food waste in Hong Kong. We're proud to partner with CHOMP and bring this important cause to the forefront.""",2024-07-12,Hong Kong,https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/chomp-and-themilsource-challenge-soho-house-hong-kong-chef-to-transform-food-waste-into-a-culinary-feast-78033

"Urad prices have started softening, rainfall enhances sowing area under Kharif","The consistent efforts of Department of Consumer Affairs have resulted in softening of Urad prices, the Centre Government's proactive measures have been pivotal in stabilising prices for consumers while ensuring favourable price realisation for farmers.The anticipation of good rainfall is expected to boost the morale of farmers, leading to the production of a good crop in major Urad producing states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. As on 05th July 2024, the area sown for Urad has reached 5.37 lakh hectares, as compared to 3.67 lakh hectares for corresponding period last year. The 90-day crop is expected to experience a healthy Kharif production this year.Ahead of the Kharif sowing season, there has been significant momentum in the pre-registration of farmers through government agencies such as NAFED and NCCF. These efforts are part of Government strategy to encourage farmers to shift towards pulse production during the Kharif season, aiming for self-sufficiency in this sector.In Madhya Pradesh alone, a total of 8,487 Urad farmers have already registered through NCCF and NAFED. Meanwhile, other major producing states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh have seen pre-registrations of 2037, 1611, and 1663 farmers respectively, indicating widespread participation in these initiatives.The procurement of summer Urad under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) by NAFED and NCCF is in progress. As a result of these initiatives, as of July 6, 2024, wholesale prices of Urad have witnessed a week-on-week decline of 3.12% and 1.08% in Indore and Delhi markets respectively. In alignment with domestic prices, the landed prices of imported Urad are also on a declining trend. These measures underscore the government's commitment to balancing market dynamics while supporting both farmers and consumers.",2024-07-12,"Our Bureau, New Delhi",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/urad-prices-have-started-softening-rainfall-enhances-sowing-area-under-kharif-78030
Hydrocyclone technology for tapioca starch and sago industry,"A hydrocyclone is a straightforward device with no moving parts. It includes a set of nozzles, usually made of plastic, housed within a watertight steel structure. Hydrocyclones are used in the starch industry mainly for purification and concentration. Its main function is to separate a mixture of solid particles and water into two distinct streams. The majorities of solid particles are concentrated in a smaller volume of water and exit through the bottom of the hydrocyclone, known as the underflow. Meanwhile, excess water is discharged from the top of the hydrocyclone, known as the overflow.How does a hydrocyclone work?Hydrocyclone is key equipment for producing cassava starch. Cassava starch milk is a mixture of extracted starch particles suspended in a large volume of water. It undergoes pressurization and is then directed into the top section of the nozzles positioned around a central aperture. Within the nozzles, the starch milk follows a circular path, generating significant centrifugal forces. These forces propel the heavier starch particles outward toward the nozzle walls, causing them to descend downwards. Eventually, the starch, now separated from water, exits through an opening at the bottom of the nozzles. On the other hand, lighter particles such as fine starch and dirt are carried along with water through the central opening at the top of the nozzles. How can hydrocyclones be installed in a starch and sago industry?During the tapioca starch extraction process, significant amounts of water are utilized for rasping and sieving. This water consumption can be reduced by directing the starch milk, which flows from the screening system, through a hydrocyclone. The starch milk is then collected in a specially designed sump tank before being pumped to the hydrocyclone at the appropriate operating pressure. The concentrated starch milk extracted from the bottom of the hydrocyclone is directed to settling tanks. The surplus water, containing a minor amount of fine starch and dirt, can be recycled back to the raspers. This recycling process helps replace the fresh water typically used for crushing.Advantages:    • Water consumption can be reduced by up to 60 %    • Volume of water can be reduced by up to 60 %    • Volume of settling tanks required is reduced    • Starch will settle quicker    • Quantity of dirt starch collected is settling tanks is reduced    • Less starch will be lost in the overflow from settling tanksAfter installing hydrocyclone technology, tailored to match the factory's capacity, regular cleaning ensures seamless and trouble-free operation. The primary installation costs include the hydrocyclone and its support structure, a pump with associated pipework and valves for connecting to the hydrocyclone, and the construction of a sump tank to collect the starch milk. The operating costs will primarily involve running the pump, yet these expenses can be offset by the savings generated from using less fresh water extracted from open or bore wells.Thus, hydrocyclones offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and versatility in various stages of starch production and refinement within the tapioca starch and sago industry.(Krishnakumar belongs to ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala; Sajeev belongs to ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala; Jyothi belongs to ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala; Pradeepika belongs to ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala; Prakash belongs to ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala; Jaganathan belongs to ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala; Velmurugan belongs to Tapioca and castor research station, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Yethapur, Salem, Tamil Nadu.

K'taka Health dept now takes on tea plantations as excess pesticide limits seen,"The Karnataka Health and Family Welfare department has swooped down on tea plantations exceeding pesticide limits. This according to the department officials is a significant step toward ensuring consumer health.The move follows after a slew of adulterated artificial food colours were found in popular street foods like kebab, pani puri, gobi manchurian and  cotton candy. Excessive pesticide use can pose serious health risks, so enforcing permissible limits is crucial. It not only protects consumers but also promotes safer agricultural practices, said the state heath officials.As of now, they have collected 48 samples taken across various districts of North Karnataka where the consumption of tea is very high. In districts like Bagalkote, Bidar, Gadag, Dharwad, Huballi, Vijayanagara, Koppal, and Ballari, the food inspectors have found large amounts of pesticides being used that could lead to major health hazards. ""This comprehensive sampling approach will provide a clearer picture of pesticide levels and potential health risks associated with tea consumption in those areas. It also underscores our commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of tea consumers"", said the department.As per a recent media report, tea is under the scrutiny of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The FSSAI has found large amounts of pesticides and colouring used in tea dust and leaves during processing. The laboratory analysed more than 35 to 40 compounds or chemicals. “The pesticides were found to be more than the prescribed limit. That is why this drive is being undertaken,"" said the official.It is crucial for authorities to take proactive measures to ensure that tea products meet safety standards, thereby safeguarding public health. The  eateries use toxic food coloring agents like Rhodamine-B and Carmoisine sending a fear wave. These substances are known to have adverse health effects, including potential toxicity and carcinogenicity. In the case of tea, the issue of pesticides and fertilisers exceeding permissible limits is another concern. Prolonged exposure to such contaminants through tea consumption could indeed increase the risk of health problems, including cancer, said the health officials.",2024-07-12,"Nandita Vijayasimha, Bengaluru",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/ktaka-health-dept-now-takes-on-tea-plantations-as-excess-pesticide-limits-seen-78034

Budget - CII for restructuring of GST with low rates for essentials,"The CII has suggested restructuring of the GST regime into a three-tier structure wherein the industry body has proposed low rates for essentials, standard rates for most goods & high rates for luxury and demerit goods. In its Budget recommendation, CII has suggested that goods which are currently out of the ambit of GST, may be brought under GST regime.CII has also asked the Government to increase the capital expenditure. Further, CII recommendation suggests Government to focus on improving the physical infrastructure in areas like irrigation, storage facilities for agricultural and allied activities including cold-chain infrastructure for facilitating value addition in agriculture.For PLI scheme, it was suggested that to encourage a larger segment of MSMEs to benefit from the PLIS, the scheme should be modified in terms of lower capital investment thresholds and production targets to include MSMEs.Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for 'nano fertilisers' open for private players was also proposed.CII also suggested establishing a National Economic Security Board under the National Security Council. Budget expectations:Sanket S, co-founder of Scandalous Foods, says, ""In this upcoming Budget, we look forward to more aggressive PLI schemes in food processing, expanded to include additional products. We advocate for subsidies in warehousing and cold chain logistics, coupled with regulations on aggregator commissions.Additionally, we hope for a directive compelling banks to promote CGTMSE schemes for startups, fostering growth without diluting equity. Furthermore, emphasising tools like Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is essential for risk mitigation and informed decision-making. In particular, continued support for the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) remains vital, ensuring small food businesses have access to credit and the necessary financial backing for sustained growth. With a young and dynamic food processing minister like Chirag Paswan, we hope for forward-looking and aggressive steps to be taken in this direction.""Vanshaj Bhatia, director of sales, Hyatt Place, Jaipur, says ,""The hospitality and tourism industry eagerly awaits the upcoming Union Budget. Varied factors and policies could help boost the sector however, past Budgets have been below expectations to say the least. In 2022, the travel and tourism sector in India contributed around 5.9 per cent to the total GDP of the country. This amounted to over 15,687 billion Indian rupees, and an increase of nearly 89.2 per cent compared to the previous year. The sheer size of the Indian market, the demographics, the increase in GDP per person and the will of people to travel are all positive indicators on how the industry is pinned to perform. Make no mistake hospitality companies both Indian & multinational are scheduled to launch new brands and new hotels in the next few years thereby bolstering the supply, pan-India. The upcoming Budget will surely have all these factors in play along with key areas that impact the industry such as Taxation, support for SMEs & MSMEs and Infrastructure Investments.""Komal Agarwal co-founder, Talli Tales, says, ""The alcobev industry is eagerly anticipating the upcoming Union Budget, with several key expectations. Firstly, there is a strong push for policy changes to allow home delivery of alcohol, which would cater to growing consumer demand for convenience and boost e-commerce channels. Secondly, the industry advocates for the inclusion of alcohol under the GST regime, which would simplify the tax structure and reduce consumer costs by replacing the complex state-specific taxes. Lastly, there is a pressing need to address the volatility in the prices of Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), crucial for production, by stabilising the costs of un-denatured alcohol to ensure consistent pricing and production efficiency.""",2024-07-11,"Ashwani Maindola, New Delhi",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/budget--cii-for-restructuring-of-gst-with-low-rates-for-essentials-78024

Misleading advertisements of food products galore,"The Nutrition Advocacy in Public interest (NAPi) released its new report ‘50 Shades of Food Advertising’, exposing how seductive, luring, manipulative or deceptive these advertisements can be. Consequences of such advertising are increased intake of unhealthy food products that are associated with obesity and diabetes. India is facing a dubious distinction of persistent under nutrition among children under five, and a rising trend of obesity and diabetes among grown-ups. Not something India can be proud of when it is aspiring to be a 5 trillion economy and world leader in almost every field. These conditions can only make a population of less productive adults who will perform below par.The 2023, ICMR-INDIAB study shows there are 100 million cases of diabetes and 1 in every 4 individuals is either suffering from diabetes or is pre-diabetic or obese. The more recent ICMR -NIN’s “Dietary Guidelines for Indians” reveal that more than 10% of 5–19year-olds are pre-diabetic. The Government of India had set a target to halt the rise of obesity and diabetes by 2025, under the National Mult-Sector Action Plan to Prevent and Control NCDs (2017-2022), which seems nowhere in sight. One of the major underlying factors for rise in obesity and diabetes is increasing consumption of unhealthy diets triggered by pervasive and aggressive advertising and marketing of unhealthy high fat, high sugar, high salt (HFSS) food products, or ultra processed food (UPF) products. These are making an entry into the diets of Indians, replacing their traditional diets. These products are usually high in sugars, salt or fats, which are better described asNutrients of Concern - According to a study conducted by the WHO- India Office, the retail sale of ultra processed food products in India is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 13.3% between 2011 and 2021. According to Kantar's FMCG Pulse report, 50% of Indian households consumed bottled soft drinks in the 12 months ending March 2024, which is a 19% increase from previous years.  One of the WHO-India’s unpublished report showed that about 200,000 advertisements of HFSS are blasted every month on select TV, print or digital mediums. This report, ‘50 Shades of Food Advertising’ provides clear-cut evidence of how food and drink products are being advertised by using different appeals such as evoking emotional feelings, manipulating use of experts, appropriating benefits real fruits, using celebrities to add value to the brand, projecting as healthy etc while all of these 50 food products would fall under the category of unhealthy/HFSS or UPFs. The report also provides information on the gaps in the existing legislations, such as FSS Act 2006, the Cable TV Networks Regulation Act, 1994 and Rules, the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 and the Norms of Journalistic Conduct 2022. The report highlights how to bridge these gaps. The Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest (NAPi) has submitted a set of amendments to the ministries of the Press Council of India, Ministry of information and broadcasting as well as the Ministry of consumer affairs.The report finds that these advertisements mislead on many counts. Most food advertisements conceal ‘important information’ about nutrients of concern mandated by the Consumer Protection Act 2019.  The Advertisement Code of the Cable TV regulation Act 1994 provides that, ‘No advertisement which endangers the safety of children or creates in them any interest in unhealthy practices shall not be carried in the cable service’.  All food product advertisements can lead to unhealthy practices. NAPi therefore recommends to stop any food advertisements if the food product is HFSS and UPFand makes further recommendations for Amendment to the above regulations to include, in an explicit manner the definition of HFSS and prohibit advertisements which carry food items beyond the thresholds of this definition. Food product advertisements deserve a special treatment, these are not like other consumer goods. The Lancet in February 2024 published a view of the experts that concluded “A robust regulatory framework is needed to protect children from HFSS food marketing, not just what is ‘directed’ at them, with clear evidence-based food classification criteria.”According to Dr Arun Gupta, who is a paediatrician and convenor of NAPi, “This is the least the Government of India can do and it is part of its plan to begin a halt to the rising consumption of unhealthy diets and thus on obesity and diabetes. Meanwhile, as amendments may take some time, Government of India can implement that each advertisement must disclose in bold letters the amount of nutrient of concern per 100gram/ml. It would be in the best interest of the people’s health that a public health ‘Bill’ is proposed in the Parliament to halt obesity. If we fail to halt the rising trend, it will only result in increasing the disease and economic burden, year by year, on the individual family and the health system as a whole.”“Under the Right to Information, we have found that FSSAI takes 1-2 years to refer the matter of misleading advertisements to a committee, which keeps on clarifying from companies. But out of more than 100 cases none has been fined as per rules even as the FSSAI committee found these to be misleading. This is gross injustice to the consumers, people of India. Such a delay allows companies to enjoy the ‘freedom’ to advertise and make money while public health may suffer. This is the reason the report also provides an objective method of identifying what is misleading food advertising so that a quick decision can be made. NAPi also recommends this to be adapted and used by authorities to make quick decisions on what is misleading and take action immediately,” says Dr Nupur Bidla, a member of NAPi and a social scientist.” In 2022, the World Health Organisation published a report on Food Marketing, the 2022 report, which observed, ‘It confirms that marketing of foods that contribute to unhealthy diets remains pervasive and persuasive and provides evidence that strengthens the rationale for action to restrict food marketing to which children are exposed’. Later, WHO in 2023 recommended strong policies to protect children from harmful marketing.  Dr Vandana Prasad, a community paediatrician and member of NAPi, said, “The Southeast Asia regional office of the WHO provided a Nutrient profile model and a set of thresholds of sugar, sodium and fats in 18 categories of food products beyond which it recommended prohibition of marketing. Now that the ICMR-NIN guideline has provided thresholds for sugar, high fat and sodium, in both solids and liquids, these should be used for regulations and creating an official definition of HFSS.” ",2024-07-11,"Our Bureau, New Delhi",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/misleading-advertisements-of-food-products-galore-78017

Deepak Fertilisers cuts data analysis time by 70% with Agmatix,"India’s largest fertiliser company, Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation, has successfully reduced their time to collate, verify, and analyse agronomic data by 70%, from six months to under one month using the Agmatix platform. The field trial software and data analysis system has helped the company detect and prevent errors in their product development trials, resulting in high-quality efficacy data for over 1,500 annual trials conducted through the platform.Previously, agronomists manually entered multiple parameters per crop trial and across 25 sites each, using pen-and-paper field notebooks. This time-consuming method posed significant risks of data loss and entry errors. The data collector for agronomic trials has significantly reduced inaccuracies through instantaneous mobile data collection. The digital notebook allows the upload of images, notes, and videos alongside collection location data and timestamps, securely storing all data in the cloud.“Before integrating Agmatix’s solution, I spent months manually collating agronomists' data, delaying business presentations. Now, the platform handles it instantly, allowing me to focus on other tasks. I tried other platforms, but they weren’t suitable for our needs. Agmatix Trial Management fits seamlessly into our existing IT systems, and the team worked closely with me to create bespoke modifications to perfectly fit our requirements,” said senior manager R&D project and data lead at Deepak.Ron Baruchi, CEO of Agmatix, said, “Agricultural input companies are facing increasing pressure to maximise efficiency and output with limited resources. Digitization is key to cultivating a competitive edge, enabling faster transitions from product testing and development to registration and sales. By deploying our technology, businesses like Deepak are advancing sustainable agriculture and enabling higher yields by continually developing their products in smart and efficient ways, contributing to global food security.”",2024-07-11,"St. Louis, Missouri",https://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/deepak-fertilisers-cuts-data-analysis-time-by-70-with-agmatix-78015
